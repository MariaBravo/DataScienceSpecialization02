Q6

If a random variable, X, is so that E[X]=µ  and Var(X)=s2   what is the mean and variance of Z=X-µs?

Hi, you need to know the properties of the mean function and variance function.

For this particular question, you need these following properties

1) E[ax]=aE[x] if a is a constant 
2) E[x-a]=E[x]-a if a is a constant 
3) Var(ax)=a2*Var(x) if a is a constant 
4) Var(x-a)=Var(x) if a is a constant
