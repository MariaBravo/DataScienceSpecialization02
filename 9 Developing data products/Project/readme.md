- This application predicts the prostate cancer tumor logarithm volume (lcavol) using five covariates (age, log of bph, log of cp, log of psa, the Gleason score) and the regression tree method. The values of lbph, lcp and lpsa must be entered as logarithms. The logarithm volume value for the tumor is displayed in cubic centimeters.
- Note that because of the tree structure, in order to quickly trigger a change in the prediction value, the following variables should preferably be changed: lcp (enter values greater or less than 0.261624), lpsa (enter values greater or less than 2.30257), lcp (enter values greater or less than 2.13963).
