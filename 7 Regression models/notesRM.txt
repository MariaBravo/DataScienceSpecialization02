The mean of a variable is the coefficient of its regression against the constant, 1.
 Thus, subtracting the mean is equivalent to replacing a variable by the residual of its
 regression against 1. In an R formula, the constant regressor can be represented by a 1
 on the right hand side. Thus, the expression, lm(child ~ 1, galton), regresses child
 against the constant, 1. Recall that in the galton data, the mean height of a child was
 68.09 inches. Use lm(child ~ 1, galton) to compare the resulting coefficient (the
 intercept) and the mean height of 68.09. Since we want the result to print, don't assign
 it a name.
